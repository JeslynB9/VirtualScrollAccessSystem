Pancakes, golden, warm, and round,
Morning treats where joy is found.
Stacked up high, with butter gleam,
Dripping syrup, a breakfast dream.

Flip them once, then flip them twice,
Soft and fluffy, pure delight.
Berries, chocolate, or honey sweet,
Perfect layers, ready to eat.

Morning sun, through the window bright,
Pancakes sizzling, a lovely sight.
Fork in hand, take a bite,
Simple pleasures, pure delight.

Maple rivers, flowing slow,
On those pancakes, watch them glow.
Every bite, a soft embrace,
Pancakes make the world a better place.
